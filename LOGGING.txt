LOGGING STRATEGY
================

Overview
--------
The application uses the built-in .NET Core ILogger abstraction. 
Logs are currently written to the Console (Standard Output) which is suitable for containerized environments (Docker/Kubernetes).

Configuration
-------------
Defined in `appsettings.json` under "Logging" section.

Levels
------
- Information: Standard request logs, startup info.
- Warning: Non-critical issues (e.g., bad login attempts).
- Error: Exceptions caught by Global Exception Handler (500 errors).

Future Extension
----------------
To persist logs to a file or external system (ELK, Seq), a sink like Serilog can be easily added without changing the code logic, thanks to ILogger.
