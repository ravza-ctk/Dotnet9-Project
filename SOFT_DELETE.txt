SOFT DELETE IMPLEMENTATION
==========================

Concept
-------
Records are never physically removed from the database `DELETE` statement. 
Instead, they are marked as deleted to preserve history and maintain referential integrity.

Mechanism
---------
1. Field: Every entity inherits from `BaseEntity` which includes:
   `public bool IsDeleted { get; set; }`

2. Delete Operation:
   The `GenericRepository.DeleteAsync` method sets `IsDeleted = true` and updates the entity instead of removing it.

3. Query Filter (Global):
   `AppDbContext.OnModelCreating` configures a global Query Filter:
   `builder.Entity<T>().HasQueryFilter(x => !x.IsDeleted);`
   
   This ensures that "deleted" records are automatically excluded from all LINQ queries (Get, GetAll) without needing to manually add `.Where(x => !x.IsDeleted)` every time.

4. Restore:
   To restore a record, direct DB access or a specific 'Restore' endpoint (not currently publicly exposed) would set `IsDeleted = false`.
